# Browser Tests

Conventions for Pest browser tests (`tests/Browser/`, the `visit()` API). These
prevent the most common avoidable failures.

## Select by data attribute, never by visible text

Target elements with a `data-test` attribute and Pest's `@` selector — **not** the
visible label. Pest resolves `@create-project` to `[data-testid=create-project],
[data-test=create-project]`.

```blade
<flux:button wire:click="$set('showCreate', true)" data-test="create-project">
    {{ __('New project') }}
</flux:button>
```

```php
$page->click('@create-project')
    ->fill('@project-title', 'My Cool Project')
    ->assertValue('@project-short-name', 'MCP');
```

Why: a visible label like "New project" is rarely unique — the same text can appear
in a page button, the command palette, the sidebar, or a heading. `click('New
project')` then resolves to the wrong (often hidden) element and times out instead
of failing clearly. Data attributes are unambiguous and survive copy edits and
translation. Add a `data-test` to any element a test interacts with or asserts on.

## Assert on data-test selectors, not visible text

The same reasoning applies to assertions. Assert an element's presence with
`assertVisible`/`assertMissing` against a `@selector` — **not** `assertSee`/
`assertDontSee` of a text string.

```php
// Brittle — passes if the words appear anywhere; breaks on copy edits & translation
$page->assertSee('Cancel task');

// Robust — targets one specific element by its data-test attribute
$page->assertVisible('@cancel-task-button');
$page->click('@cancel-task-button')
    ->assertMissing('@cancel-task-button');
```

Why: `assertSee('Cancel task')` passes whenever those words appear anywhere on the
page — a tooltip, an unrelated heading, the document title — so it can pass while the
real control is absent, and fails the moment a label is reworded or translated.
`assertVisible('@cancel-task-button')` asserts that one specific element is present
and visible, regardless of its text. Use `assertSeeIn('@selector', $text)` only when
the rendered text content itself is what you're verifying (a count, a user-entered
value) — scope it to the element rather than the whole page.

## `screenshot()` takes a boolean first, filename second

The signature is `screenshot(bool $fullPage = true, ?string $filename = null)`. The
**first** argument is `$fullPage`, not the filename — passing a filename first throws
a `TypeError`. Images are written to `tests/Browser/Screenshots/`.

```php
$page->screenshot();                         // full page, auto-named after the test
$page->screenshot(false, 'command-palette'); // viewport only, custom name
```

## Always assert no JS errors

End interactive browser tests with `->assertNoJavascriptErrors()` so silent
client-side failures surface.

=== .ai/feature-documentation rules ===

# Feature Documentation

Keep the documentation in sync with the application's features. Whenever you add
or modify a feature, update the docs in the same change — undocumented behavior
is treated as incomplete work.

## What to document

- The user-facing features list in `README.md`.
- Any feature-specific docs under `docs/`.

Describe **what** a feature does, not how it is implemented. Add a technical
detail only when it is relevant to using the feature (e.g. "registration is
invitation-only", "notifications auto-subscribe assignees"). Skip internal
mechanics, class names, and step-by-step implementation notes.

## Style

- Be concise and focused. Keep it basic — no trivial details.
- One feature, one short entry. Prefer a sentence over a paragraph.
- Match the tone and structure of the surrounding documentation.

## Boy Scout rule

Leave documentation cleaner than you found it. While editing any doc, fix issues
you notice in it — stale descriptions, broken references, removed features still
listed, inconsistent terminology — even if they are unrelated to your change.

=== .ai/static-closures rules ===

# Static Closures

Declare a closure `static` whenever its body does **not** use `$this`. This silences the IDE "closure can be declared static" hint and avoids needless `$this` binding. The rule applies to **both** arrow functions (`fn`) and multi-line closures (`function () { ... }`) — convert every form, not just short arrow functions.

```php
// Arrow functions
$ids->map(static fn (int $id): int => $id * 2);
Gate::define('create-projects', static fn (User $user): bool => $user->can_create_projects);

// Multi-line closures — same rule
Schema::create('users', static function (Blueprint $table): void { /* ... */ });
RateLimiter::for('login', static function (Request $request): Limit { /* ... */ });

// Eloquent model event hooks — static IS correct here. The model arrives as the
// closure argument, so the closure is never bound to an instance.
static::created(static function (Model $model): void {
    $model->recordActivity('created');
});
```

## Do NOT make these static — Laravel binds them to an instance at runtime

Marking them `static` throws `Cannot bind an instance to a static closure` (fatal in PHP 9). Leave them as regular closures even when no `$this` appears in the body:

- **Model factory closures**: `$this->state(...)`, `$this->afterMaking(...)`, `$this->afterCreating(...)`, and `configure()` callbacks. Eloquent rebinds these to the factory instance.
- **Attribute accessors/mutators** that read or write model state via `$this`: `Attribute::get(fn () => $this->...)`.
- **Any closure that uses `$this`**: Artisan command closures (`$this->info(...)`), route closures bound to a controller, `DB::transaction(fn () => $this->...)`, etc.

> Note: Eloquent model event hooks (`static::creating/created/updating/deleting/saved`, in `booted()` or a `bootHasX()` trait method) are **not** an exception — they take the model as an argument and should be `static`.

When unsure whether a closure gets bound, run the test suite — a static-closure binding error surfaces immediately.

## Pest tests

Ignore the "could be declared static" hint inside Pest test closures (`test()`, `it()`, `beforeEach()`, datasets, etc.). Pest binds those closures to the `TestCase`, so the hint is a false positive — do not make them static.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allow to build dynamic, reactive interfaces in PHP without writing JavaScript.
- You can use Alpine.js for client-side interactions instead of JavaScript frameworks.
- Keep state server-side so the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions as you would in HTTP requests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- The `{name}` argument should not include the test suite directory. Use `php artisan make:test --pest SomeFeatureTest` instead of `php artisan make:test --pest Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.
