{{--
    Override of Flux's flux:command.items. Identical to the package's published
    stub, but kept here so the empty-state label resolves through __() and gets a
    German translation (KAN-195) — Flux's built-in default renders a hardcoded
    English "No results found". Re-sync with the vendor stub on Flux upgrades.
