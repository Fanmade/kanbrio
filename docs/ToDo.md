## MCP Server
MCP support at `/mcp`. Agents are authorized by a user via a personal API token
(read-only or read & write) and act in that user's name, restricted to projects
they can access. Done:
- Read access to projects, stories and tasks (any token).
- Creating projects (requires the "create-projects" permission), stories and tasks.
- Managing stories and tasks (title, description, task status).
- Adding comments to projects, stories and tasks.

Write tools require a token with the `write` ability.

## Improve user assignment UI
