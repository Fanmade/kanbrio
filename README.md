# Kanbrio

![Tests](https://github.com/Fanmade/kanbrio/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)
![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Fanmade/89b10cbc79557b748b8f50d2955dd9f6/raw/coverage.json)

A minimalist, invitation-only Kanban project-management tool. Organize work as
**Projects → Stories → Tasks**, with human-readable scoped URLs, a drag-and-drop
board, comments, attachments, an audit trail, and per-project notifications.

Built on Laravel with Livewire and Flux UI. English and German out of the box.

> ⚠️ **Early development** — Kanbrio is still under active development and is **not
> yet considered production ready**. Expect breaking changes, and use it in
> production at your own risk.

## Features

- **Projects, Stories & Tasks** — three-level hierarchy with project-scoped story
  numbers and story-scoped task numbers.
- **Focused item views** — the project, story and task pages keep the description
  front and centre, with metadata (status, priority, assignees, dependencies,
  dates) gathered in a compact side rail. Status and priority are badges that open
  a dropdown to change them, and editing controls stay tucked away until needed.
- **Readable scoped URLs** — `/{SHORT}` for a project, `/{SHORT}{n}` for a story,
  `/{SHORT}{n}-{m}` for a task (e.g. `/ABC`, `/ABC1`, `/ABC1-3`).
- **Command palette** (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`) — search projects, stories and tasks by
  title or tag, jump straight to a typed reference, and run quick actions.
- **Kanban board** — drag-and-drop across the four statuses (Planned, ToDo,
  In progress, Done), per project or globally across every project you can see.
  Dragging is smoothly animated with highlighted drop targets and works on touch;
  each card also has a keyboard-accessible "Move to" menu. Cards keep the order
  you arrange them in within each column.
- **Story completion progress bars** on the project overview, in the story
  header, and on story search results — each based on the share of its tasks done.
- **Archiving** — archive finished tasks or whole stories to clear them from the
  board and project overview without deleting them. Archived items are hidden by
  default and revealed with a "Show archived" toggle; archiving keeps a task's
  status and is fully reversible.
- **Dashboard** — per-status task counts, a 14-day completion chart, and a "My
  tasks" list for picking the next thing to work on: your in-progress and to-do
  tasks plus unassigned to-do tasks across your projects (work assigned to others
  is hidden), in-progress first.
- **Multi-assignee** stories and tasks for pairing and ensemble work.
- **Profile avatars** — upload a profile picture (cropped to a square) from
  profile settings; it shows wherever you appear — assignees, comment authors and
  member lists — with your initials as the fallback when you have none.
- **Comments** with one-level replies, editing, and soft-delete tombstones. The
  whole section can be collapsed, remembered per user.
- **Attachments** — drag files onto a description to upload them, with inline
  image and PDF thumbnails. Files above the size limit are rejected with a
  clear message.
- **Tags** on stories and tasks.
- **Priorities** — five levels (Lowest, Low, Medium, High, Highest; Medium is the
  default) on stories and tasks, with new tasks inheriting their story's priority.
  Board columns are ordered by priority and can be filtered to a single level.
- **Due dates** on stories and tasks, highlighted on the board when overdue.
- **Dependencies** — mark a story or task as blocked by, or blocking, another
  item (by reference). Blockers and blocked items are listed on the item view,
  and a card is flagged "Blocked" on the board while any blocker is unfinished.
  Self-links and cycles are rejected.
- **Notifications** — subscribe per project (assignment auto-subscribes you),
  manage everything from a dedicated page, unread badge in the header.
- **Markdown** descriptions and comments.
- **Activity log** — polymorphic audit trail of creations, status changes, and
  assignment changes. Collapsed by default; the open/closed state is remembered
  per user.
- **Invitation-only onboarding** via signed, expiring email links (public
  registration is disabled).
- **User administration** — an admin-only area (gated by the `manage-users`
  permission) to review every account, grant or revoke permissions, resend or
  revoke pending invitations, and deactivate (reversible, blocks sign-in) or
  remove accounts. Removed accounts are soft-deleted with their assignments
  dropped; comments they wrote are kept as the work of a "deleted user".
- **Authorization** via native Gates (`create-projects`, `invite-users`,
  `create-api-tokens`, `manage-users`) and Policies that cascade through project
  membership.
- **API tokens** — permitted users mint personal Sanctum tokens (read-only or
  read & write) for MCP/API access and revoke them from Settings.
- **MCP server** — a Model Context Protocol endpoint at `/mcp`, secured by a bearer
  token, that lets AI agents work with the projects, stories, and tasks the token's
  owner can access. Read tools (list/inspect) work with any token; write tools
  (create/update stories & tasks, create projects, add comments) require a token
  with write access. Agents can also read attachments — including inline
  description images — by their id.
- **Localization** — English and German, defaulting to the browser language with
  a switcher in Appearance settings.

## Tech stack

- PHP 8.4+ / Laravel 13
- Livewire 4 + Flux UI Pro
- Laravel Fortify (login, email verification, 2FA, passkeys)
- Tailwind CSS 4
- SQLite (default), Vite
- Pest 4, Larastan, Pint

> **Note:** This project uses [Flux UI Pro](https://fluxui.dev), a commercial
> package. A valid Flux Pro license is required to run `composer install`.

## Getting started

Requirements: PHP 8.4+, Composer, Node.js, and a Flux Pro license.

```bash
# Install dependencies, create .env, generate the key, migrate, and build assets
composer setup

# Seed the database (creates the configured admin and local demo data)
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Run the full dev stack (server, queue, logs, Vite)
composer dev
```

The app is served at <http://localhost:8000>.

### Default admin

The seeder creates an administrator (with all permissions) only when you set
both credentials in your `.env`:

```dotenv
ADMIN_NAME="Admin"        # optional, defaults to "Admin"
ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me
```

The admin can create projects and invite users. In `local`, the `DemoSeeder`
also populates example projects, stories, and tasks (and seeds its own demo
admin if none is configured).

## Inviting users

Public registration is disabled by design. Users with the `invite-users`
capability send a signed invitation link by email (use the bottom of the
sidebar). With `MAIL_MAILER=log` (the default), the link is written to
`storage/logs/laravel.log`. Opening the link lets the invitee set their name and
password, after which they land on the security setup page.

## Testing & quality

The full quality gate runs Pint, Larastan, and Pest:

```bash
composer test
```

Individual checks:

```bash
composer lint          # Pint (apply fixes)
composer types:check   # Larastan / PHPStan
php artisan test       # Pest
composer test:coverage # Pest with line coverage + minimum threshold
```

CI measures line coverage on every run, fails if it drops below the configured
threshold, and publishes the current level to the coverage badge above.

Browser tests (Pest 4 + Playwright) live in `tests/Browser` and run as a
separate suite so the default gate stays fast and Playwright-free:

```bash
composer test:browser
```

They require the Playwright Chromium binary (`npx playwright install chromium`).

## Project layout

- `app/Livewire/` — class-based Livewire components (board, projects, stories,
  tasks, comments, notifications, invitations).
- `app/Concerns/` — shared model traits (scoped numbering, activity logging,
  comments, tags, attachments, subscriptions).
- `app/Models/` — Project, Story, Task, Comment, Attachment, Activity,
  Invitation, User.
- `app/Policies/` — per-resource authorization cascading through membership.
- `lang/` — English source strings inline; German in `de.json` and `de/`.
- `routes/web.php` — scoped routing for projects, stories, and tasks.
