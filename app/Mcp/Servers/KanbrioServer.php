    Kanbrio is a project-management board. The data model is a hierarchy:

    - A project groups work and has a short_name (2-4 uppercase letters), title and description.
      A project is referenced by its short_name, e.g. "PROJ".
    - A project contains tasks. A task is referenced by its project's short_name plus a
      project-wide task number, e.g. "PROJ-42". Each task has a status: one of "Planned", "ToDo",
      "In progress", "Done" or "Canceled".
    - Tasks can nest: a task may have subtasks, which are themselves tasks (referenced the same
      flat way, e.g. "PROJ-43"). A task without a parent is a top-level task in its project.

    You act as the authenticated user and can only ever see or change data for projects the user
    is a member of; tasks inherit access from their project. If a project or task does not exist
    or the user cannot access it, the tool returns an error.

    A task can be canceled (abandoned with a reason) rather than deleted. The update-task tool
    accepts a "cancel_reason" (one of "WontFix", "Duplicate", "Deprecated") with an optional
    "cancel_message" to cancel a task — which also cancels its open subtasks — and "reopen": true
    to reopen a canceled task back to "Planned". Cancellation is a terminal state distinct from the
    working statuses, so it is not set through the "status" field. The get-task and list-tasks tools
    report a canceled task's "cancel_reason" (and get-task its "cancel_message").

    Tasks can depend on each other: a task may be "blocked by" the tasks it depends on (its
    blockers) and may itself "block" others. The get-task tool reports a task's "blocked_by" and
    "blocks" references plus an "is_blocked" flag (true while a blocker is not yet complete); the
    list-tasks tool includes the "is_blocked" flag. Use the add-dependency tool to link tasks
    (direction "blocked_by": reference is blocked by related_reference; "blocks": reference blocks
    related_reference) and the remove-dependency tool to unlink them. Self-dependencies and cycles
    are rejected.

    Task and project descriptions are HTML, restricted to a small allow-list: headings,
    bold/italic, lists, links, blockquotes, code, and inline images (rendered as a thumbnail
    linking to the full-size image). The get tools return descriptions as HTML, and the
    create/update tools expect description content as HTML — whatever you send is sanitized to
    that allow-list, so unsupported tags are dropped. (Comment bodies, in contrast, are Markdown.)

    Projects and tasks may have file attachments, including images embedded inline in their
    descriptions. The get tools list each attachment's id; pass that id to the get-attachment
    tool to retrieve the file's content (images and audio are returned as viewable content).

    Projects and tasks can also carry a discussion thread. The get tools (not the list tools)
    return a "comments" array, oldest first; each comment has an id, author name, body,
    created-at timestamp and the parent_id of the comment it replies to (null for a top-level
    comment). A deleted comment is kept as a tombstone with an empty body and "is_deleted": true
    when it still has replies. Use the add-comment tool to post a new comment.

    Read tools (list/get) are available to any token. Write tools (create/update/comment, link or
    unlink dependencies) require a token with write access and return an error for read-only
    tokens. Creating a project also requires the "create-projects" permission.
